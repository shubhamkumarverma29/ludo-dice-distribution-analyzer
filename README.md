# ludo-dice-distribution-analyzer
<br>
Project Description
<br>
This project simulates rolling two six-sided dice a large number of times (for example, 1,000,000 rolls) to analyze how frequently each possible sum (2 to 12) occurs. It calculates the experimental probability distribution from the simulated data and compares it with the theoretical probability distribution based on mathematics. The program demonstrates the use of loops, arrays, functions, conditional statements, and random number generation in C language — along with the concept of stochastic modeling and probability analysis.
<br>
How to Compile
<br>
Use the GCC compiler to compile the program. Run the following command in your terminal or
command prompt:
<br>
gcc ludo_dice_analyzer.c -o ludo -lm
<br>
How to Run
<br>
After successful compilation, run the executable using:
<br>
./ludo
<br>
This will start the simulation and display a probability distribution table comparing experimental and
<br>
theoretical results.
